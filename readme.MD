## Car Purchase Prediction ML Model

This project includes a machine learning model that predicts whether a user will purchase a car based on their age, annual salary, and gender. The Flask web application allows users to input these parameters and receive a prediction.

## Getting Started

To use the Flask app:

1. Copy the contents of the Phase 4 folder.
2. Activate the virtual environment using `/myenv/activate`.
3. Run the Flask app using the command `flask run`.
